My interest in the tech field began in high school, when I took a technical course in system development. That’s when I had my first real experience with programming and built my first complete web application. Since then, I’ve been expanding my knowledge, studying languages like C and C++, improving my web and mobile development skills, and diving into lower-level concepts like operating systems and computer architecture. Right now, I’ve been focusing on cybersecurity and DevOps.
